The cab it is also available in "long" version under del folder ./stl/long. Only cab, top and wings differ from the short cab.

You can use the STL files to 3D print your cab and you can sell it but in this case, please, mention the source (this repository). 

Consider the fact that I spent hundred of hours (of my free time) to model this cab and I am sharing it free of charge.
